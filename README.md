# **Setting up your Python Machine Learning system**
Set up a Python 3 virtual environment on an Ubuntu system for doing Machine Learning / Deep Learning

These notes assume that the reader is has just installed Linux, preferably an Ubuntu variant like Ubuntu-MATE, which is the best :) If you insist on using Windows, then these notes are not for you; try installing Anaconda for example, which seems to exist mostly to help Windows users do scientific/engineering coding in Python. If you are using Linux, however, there is no need for anything like Anaconda. Python 3 provides a native way to set up a virtual environment called 'venv', and for those stuck using Python 2.7, there is a package named 'virtualenv'. Below we will build Python 3.6 on our system in the /opt directory where it will be out of the way and we won't have to think about it anymore. Then we will install a virtual envirionment in our home directory which links to the /opt version we installed. Then we will use pip to install any package that we need into that virtual environment. Easy-peasy and we didn't have to install extra stuff like Anaconda to do hand-holding for us.
